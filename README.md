# Hack4Impact Fall 2025 Application Assessment

Welcome to the Hack4Impact Fall 2025 application assessment! This project is a movie search application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Your Task

Your goal is to complete the functionality of this application. You have been provided with a set up codebase.
Follow the instructions below to get started on the assessment. The document with more detailed instructions for the assessment is also linked [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YnB-So54uxA1HWc7AAPNUiTJKy87G6j0KEiadN5iwAg/edit?usp=sharing).

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set up your Environment:**
    You will need an API key from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx). Once you have your key, create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key to it:
    ```
    VITE_OMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

Good luck! We look forward to seeing your work.
